## About Me
I'm a problem-solver who finds fulfillment in serving others through technical work. Whether I'm optimizing database workflows, troubleshooting IT issues, or building integrated software systems, what drives me is the opportunity to make someone's day easier or help teams work more effectively. 

My background spans hardware, firmware, and software engineering, with recent experience in database administration and IT support. This diverse technical foundation helps me approach challenges from multiple angles and communicate effectively across technical and non-technical teams. I'm equally comfortable tackling complex technical challenges or patiently helping someone work through a problem.

I thrive in collaborative, team-based environments where I can contribute my technical skills while building genuine relationships with the people I serve. I'm drawn to roles where technical expertise meets human connection - where solving problems means helping real people do their work better.
